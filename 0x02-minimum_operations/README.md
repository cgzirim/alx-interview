# Minimum Operations
In a text file, there is a single character `H`. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: `Copy All` and `Paste`. Given a number `n`, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` `H` haracters in the file.

## Example
`n` `=` `9`
`H` => `Copy All` => `Paste` => `HH` => `Paste` => `HHH` => `Copy All` => `Paste` => `HHHHHH` => `Paste` => `HHHHHHHHH`
Number of operations: `6`

## Test

## Solution
[0-minoperations.py](https://github.com/iChigozirim/alx-interview/blob/main/0x02-minimum_operations/0-minoperations.py) - A Python function that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` `H` characters in the file.
